# Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a chronic, irreversible condition marked by the scarring of liver tissue. Early diagnosis is crucial in preventing further damage and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the risk of liver cirrhosis based on clinical data.

By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes patient input and predicts the likelihood of liver cirrhosis. The solution is integrated with a web-based Flask application to provide an interactive user experience for clinicians or users.

## Live Application

## Project Workflow

1. User provides clinical inputs through the web interface.
2. The backend model processes and analyzes the inputs.
3. The result is predicted and presented on the web interface.

## Key Features

- Multiple machine learning algorithms implemented and compared.
- Hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction performance.
- Responsive user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Flask backend for processing and prediction.
- Easily deployable structure for demonstration and further use.
